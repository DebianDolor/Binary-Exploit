# Analysis

* We are given with the below source code:

    ![image.png](./image.png)

* Lets try some random inputs:

    ![image-1.png](./image-1.png)

* It says here: "format4 looks at one method of redirecting execution in a process". So we'll use that to execute the <span style="color:red">*hello()*</span> function.

# Exploit

* Again, we start by locating the start of our input string.:


* And also, the memory address of <span style="color:red">*target*</span>:




# The bugs:

* Same like previous levels, the bug is at the <span style="color:red">*printf*</span> function.
