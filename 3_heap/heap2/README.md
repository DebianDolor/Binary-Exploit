# Analysis

* We are given with the below source code:

* Lets try some random inputs:

    
* It says: "This level examines what can happen when heap pointers are stale". This introduces us a new type of vulnerablity: <span style="color:red">*use-after-free*</span>:

* 


* Our goal, still, is to execute the <span style="color:red">*winner*</span> function.

# Exploit


* Lets find the memory address of <span style="color:red">*winner*</span> and <span style="color:red">*puts*</span>:


# The bugs:

* This level is vulnerable because we can pass as many bytes as we want via the <span style="color:red">*name[64]*</span> and the <span style="color:red">*strcpy*</span>:
