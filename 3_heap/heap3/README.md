* It says: "This level introduces the Doug Lea Malloc (dlmalloc) and how heap meta data can be modified to change program execution.". 

* This introduces us a new type of vulnerablity: <span style="color:red">*use-after-free*</span>:


* Let me run this:

# Exploit

* From the given code, I know that the <span style="color:red">*auth*</span> 

# The bugs:

* As mentioned before, this is a significant vulnerability called "use after free," in which a pointer to freed memory remains in use by a program.
