# Analysis

* We are given with the below source code:

    ![image.png](./image.png)

* The code is very similar to <span style="color:red">*stack6*</span>. If we try the same payload (modify the <span style="color:red">*ret1*</span>):

    ![image-2.png](./image-2.png)

* And run it like we did in the previous level, we still got the shell:

    ![image-1.png](./image-1.png)


# Exploit

* But the discription says: "<span style="color:red">*msfelfscan*</span> can make searching for suitable instructions very easy". So why not use that?

# The bugs:

* Same like previous levels, the bug is at the <span style="color:red">*gets*</span> function.
